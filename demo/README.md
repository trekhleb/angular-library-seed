# `angular-atomic-library` demo projects

> This folder contains two demo-projects (`esm` and `umd` folders) for [angular-atomic-library](https://github.com/tsukhu/angular-atomic-library). These demo projects may help you to test whether your library supports AOT/JIT/UMD builds or not.
>
> - `esm` folder contains Angular project that is built using [@angular/compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/compiler) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). This demo project utilizes ESM (pure ES2015) sources of your library to do two kind of compilations:
>   - [AOT](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) (ahead-of-time) compilation.
>   - [JIT](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) (just-in-time) compilation.
>
> - `umd` folder contains Angular project that is being built and assembled in browser by [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs). This demo project utilizes [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) bundle of your library.

Demo-projects are created as an alternative to `npm link` command. You may simply delete this `demo` folder if you prefer to use [yarn link](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link) instead to check how your library is being built.

# Quick Start

```bash
# Assuming the you are already in angular-atomic-library/demo folder

# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Start watching library dist folder and do JIT project build in watch mode.
yarn start

# Or you may simply build AOT/JIT/UMD versions all at once by running the following command
yarn build
```

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

#### Node/NPM
Install latest Node and NPM following the [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure you have Node version ≥ 7.0 and NPM ≥ 4.

- `brew install node` for Mac.

#### Yarn
Install Yarn by following the [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

- `brew install yarn` for Mac.

## Installing
- Switch to `demo` folder in your console.
- `yarn install` to install required dependencies.

## Replace `TickTock` library related code with your own library tags and imports
This step may be optional at first since you might just want to build demo projects with TickTock library example.

Once you're ready to develop your own library you should do the following.
- Adjust source codes of `angular-atomic-library/demo/esm/src/app/*.ts` files for AOT/JIT builds.
- Adjust source codes of `angular-atomic-library/demo/umd/app/*.ts` files for UMD builds.

## Build demo projects
- `yarn build` for building AOT, JIT and UMD demo versions all at once.

You may also build projects separately:
- `yarn build:jit` - for building JIT version of demo project.
- `yarn build:aot` - for building AOT version of demo project.
- `yarn build:umd` - for building UMD version of demo project.

To see your library in action launch the following files in your browser:
- `angular-atomic-library/demo/esm/dist/jit/index.html` file for JIT build
- `angular-atomic-library/demo/esm/dist/aot/index.html` file for AOT build
- `angular-atomic-library/demo/umd/index.html` file for UMD build

## Build JIT project in watch mode
- `yarn start` for building JIT version of demo project and start watching for library changes.

This command may be used simultaneously in combination with [angular-atomic-library](https://github.com/tsukhu/angular-atomic-library)'s `yarn build:watch`. As a result once you change library source code it will be automatically re-compiled and in turn your JIT demo-project will be automatically re-built and you will be able to see that changes in your browser instantly. 

See [Development Workflow](https://github.com/tsukhu/angular-atomic-library#development-workflow) section of [angular-atomic-library](https://github.com/tsukhu/angular-atomic-library)'s README for more details.

## Other commands

#### Cleaning
- `yarn clean:tmp` command will clean up all temporary files like `dist`, `lib`, `*.ngsummary.json` etc.
- `yarn clean:all` command will clean up all temporary files along with `node_modules` folder.
